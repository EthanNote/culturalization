# Kalman filters and Bayesian filters

https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/

>The Kalman filter was invented by Rudolf Emil Kálmán to solve this sort of problem in a mathematically optimal way. Its first use was on the Apollo missions to the moon, and since then it has been used in an enormous variety of domains.

>If we only form estimates from the measurement then the prediction will not affect the result. If we only form estimates from the prediction then the measurement will be ignored. If this is to work we need to take some kind of blend of the prediction and measurement (I've bolded the key point).
